Changes in 0.7.1

  * Fixed some stupid errors in handling of command-line bindings to source
	  ports.	

Changes in 0.7.0

  * Fixed bugs in handling of bindings for options/variables/parameters. This
	  involved a significant refactoring of input/output processing.
  * Enabled the "phone home" feature; report compound steps and options/parameters
  * Improved product-related functions and p:episode
  * Fixed the static error associated with unbound inputs on variables/parameters
  * Fixed bug that caused p:empty in side p:with-param to crash
  * Added -L option for setting the default logging level
  * Fixed namespace bindings in option value calculations
  * Fixed bugs in select handling

Changes in 0.6.3

  * Added support for p:log
  * Improved error messages; report line numbers
  * Check for err:XD0006 (writing sequences to non-sequence inputs)
  * Detect select expressions that return atomic values
  * Fixed bugs in bindings, options, and parameters when calling user-defined
	  pipelines
  * Check for attempts to use parameters when there's no parameter input port
	
Changes in 0.6.2
	
  * Fixed (some of the) bugs that caused attempts to call declared pipelines
	  to fail. It is now possible to call some simple, declared pipelines.
	
Changes in 0.6.1
	
  * Added -a option to enable schema-aware processing (attempts to use SaxonSA,
	   you must have a license for SaxonSA)
  * Fixed bug where group-adjacent was ignored on p:wrap
  * Fixed bug where step and port names could be non-NCNames
  * Fixed bug where spaces in a directory name caused an NPE; really fixed
	  it this time, I mean
  * Fixed bug where p:output was not rejected on atomic steps
  * Fixed bug where build was with Java 1.6 instead of Java 1.5
	
Changes in 0.6.0

  * Added p:filter, p:hash, p:uuid, p:www-form-urlencode, p:www-form-urldecode,
    p:exec, and p:validate-with-relax-ng
  * Added support for p:data
  * Fixed bug where spaces in a directory name caused an NPE
